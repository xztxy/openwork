Before proceeding, ask yourself: "Have I actually finished everything the user asked?"

- If YES, all parts are done → Call complete_task with status: "success"
- If you hit a blocker → Call complete_task with status: "blocked"
- If some parts done, some not → Call complete_task with status: "partial"

Keep working if there's more to do.`;

## Original Request
"${originalRequest}"

## What You Completed
${completedSummary}

## What You Said Remains
${remainingWork}

## REQUIRED: Create a Continuation Plan

Before continuing, you MUST:

1. **Review the original request** - Re-read every requirement carefully
2. **Create a TODO list** showing what's done and what remains:

**Continuation Plan:**
✓ [Items you already completed]
□ [Next step] → verify: [how to confirm it's done]
□ [Following step] → verify: [how to confirm it's done]
...

3. **Execute the plan** - Work through each remaining step
4. **Call complete_task(success)** - Only when ALL original requirements are met

## IMPORTANT RULES

- Do NOT call complete_task with "partial" again unless you hit an actual TECHNICAL blocker
- If you hit a real blocker (login wall, CAPTCHA, rate limit, site error), use "blocked" status
- "partial" is NOT an acceptable final status - keep working until the task is complete
- Do NOT ask the user "would you like me to continue?" - just continue working

Now create your continuation plan and resume working on the remaining items.`;
