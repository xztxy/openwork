Call complete_task NOW with:
- status: "success" if you finished everything the user asked
- status: "blocked" if you hit a problem and cannot continue
- status: "partial" if you completed some parts but not all

Do not respond with text. Just call the tool immediately.`;

You claimed to have completed the task with this summary:
"${summary}"

The original request was:
"${originalRequest}"

Before I accept completion, you MUST verify your work:

1. Take a screenshot of the current browser state using the browser tool
2. Review your plan's completion criteria
3. Compare the screenshot against each criterion

Then either:
- If ALL criteria are met: Call complete_task again with status="success"
- If ANY criteria are NOT met: Continue working to complete them

Do NOT call complete_task with success unless the screenshot proves the task is done.`;
