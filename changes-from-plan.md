| --- | ---------- | ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------- |
| 1   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/web/src/client/vite-env.d.ts`                        | Created vite-env.d.ts with `/// <reference types="vite/client" />`                   | Asset imports (SVG, PNG) failed typecheck without Vite client type declarations | Task 1/Task 7  |
| 2   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/desktop/package.json`                                | Kept `zod` as dependency in desktop                                                  | `src/main/config.ts` imports zod directly — needed for typecheck               | Task 5         |
| 3   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/desktop/package.json`                                | Added `concurrently` as devDependency                                                | Needed to run web dev server and electron concurrently in dev script            | Task 5         |
| 4   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/web/__tests__/unit/renderer/lib/*.unit.test.ts`      | Changed `@renderer/` imports to `@/` and `src/renderer/` relative paths to `@/`      | Web package uses `@/` alias (not `@renderer/`), old paths don't exist          | Task 3/Task 7  |
| 5   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/web/__tests__/integration/renderer/App.*.test.tsx`   | Updated test to use `createMemoryRouter` + `RouterProvider` instead of `MemoryRouter` | App now uses `useOutlet()` which requires route context from data router        | Task 3/Task 7  |
| 6   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/desktop/__tests__/setup.ts`                          | Removed `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers and DOM mocks from desktop setup         | Desktop no longer has testing-library as dependency (renderer tests in web)     | Task 5/Task 7  |
| 7   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/desktop/package.json` `build.extraResources`         | Used `extraResources` to copy web's dist instead of `files` array                     | `files` array with `../web/dist/` relative path is unreliable for asar packing  | Task 5         |
| 8   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts`                           | Used `process.resourcesPath + 'web-ui'` in prod instead of relative `../web/dist/`   | extraResources copies to resourcesPath, more reliable than relative paths       | Task 5         |
| 9   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist  | `apps/web/src/client/App.tsx`                              | Kept both named export `App` and `export default App`                                | Router uses `Component: App` (named), existing tests import default             | Task 2         |
