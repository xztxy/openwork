| --- | ---------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| 1   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/src/client/vite-env.d.ts`                    | Created vite-env.d.ts with `/// <reference types="vite/client" />`                    | Asset imports (SVG, PNG) failed typecheck without Vite client type declarations    | Task 1/Task 7  |
| 2   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/desktop/package.json`                            | Kept `zod` as dependency in desktop                                                   | `src/main/config.ts` imports zod directly — needed for typecheck                  | Task 5         |
| 3   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/desktop/package.json`                            | Added `concurrently` as devDependency                                                 | Needed to run web dev server and electron concurrently in dev script               | Task 5         |
| 4   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/__tests__/unit/renderer/lib/*.unit.test.ts`  | Changed `@renderer/` imports to `@/` and `src/renderer/` relative paths to `@/`       | Web package uses `@/` alias (not `@renderer/`), old paths don't exist             | Task 3/Task 7  |
| 5   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/__tests__/integration/renderer/App.*.test.*` | Updated test to use `createMemoryRouter` + `RouterProvider` instead of `MemoryRouter`  | App now uses `useOutlet()` which requires route context from data router           | Task 3/Task 7  |
| 6   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/desktop/__tests__/setup.ts`                      | Removed `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers and DOM mocks from desktop setup          | Desktop no longer has testing-library as dependency (renderer tests in web)        | Task 5/Task 7  |
| 7   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/package.json`                                | Changed `react-router-dom` to `react-router` (^7.13.0)                                | Enterprise uses `react-router` v7 directly, not `react-router-dom`                | Enterprise fix |
| 8   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | All web src + test files (19 files)                    | Replaced `react-router-dom` imports with `react-router`                                | Consistent with enterprise patterns                                               | Enterprise fix |
| 9   | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/src/client/main.tsx`                         | Removed `initTheme()` call and import                                                  | Enterprise doesn't have it — theme handled elsewhere                              | Enterprise fix |
| 10  | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/src/client/App.tsx`                          | Restored `isRunningInElectron()` check, removed `'use client'`, removed default export | Enterprise keeps Electron gate; no `use client` directive; named export only      | Enterprise fix |
| 11  | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/__tests__/setup.ts`                          | Changed to `import '@testing-library/jest-dom/vitest'`, removed ResizeObserver mock     | Matches enterprise setup pattern                                                  | Enterprise fix |
| 12  | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/tsconfig.client.json`                        | Removed agent-core from `include`, kept in `paths`                                     | Enterprise doesn't include agent-core source; paths still needed for resolution   | Enterprise fix |
| 13  | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/desktop/src/main/index.ts`                       | Renamed env var to `ACCOMPLISH_ROUTER_URL`, constant to `ROUTER_URL`                   | Matches enterprise naming pattern                                                 | Enterprise fix |
| 14  | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/desktop/package.json`                            | Build uses `fs.cpSync` to copy web dist into `dist/`, reverted extraResources approach | Enterprise copies web dist into desktop dist dir during build                     | Enterprise fix |
| 15  | 2026-02-17 | react-specialist | `apps/web/package.json`                                | Added `@types/node` as devDependency                                                   | `NodeJS.Timeout` type used in hooks/pages; was previously resolved via agent-core | Enterprise fix |
