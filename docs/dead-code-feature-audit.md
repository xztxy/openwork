# Dead Code Feature Audit

Static review date: 2026-04-16
Last updated: 2026-04-16 (post PR #947, #948)

Scope: broad static scan for large dead or half-dead feature areas after the
thought-stream cleanup. This is not a full reachability proof. It highlights
high-value candidates for team review.

## Status snapshot

Of the 10 drop candidates + 1 live wiring gap surfaced on 2026-04-16:

- **8 resolved** — daemon task-config wiring (PR #947), GWS runtime gap
  (PR #947), 4 low-risk orphan deletions (PR #948: daemon/types.ts,
  daemon/cron-utils.ts, `__scratch__/`, desktop shims, `ws` dep),
  thought-stream stale docs (PR #950 — scan confirmed the only stale
  current-state mention was `daemon-final-architecture.md` line 16;
  other hits are already-correct tombstones or pre-marked historical),
  and desktop OpenCode config generator (PR #951 — verified all 7
  exports had zero live callers; net −245 lines).
- **3 still open** — desktop-control MCP, completion continuation
  loop, "other task config features" follow-up audit (the last of
  these is now largely closed by #947, but left open until product
  confirms knowledge-notes / cloud-browser / language flows
  end-to-end).

## Summary

The biggest remaining risks are not small unused helpers. They are either dead
feature surfaces that should be removed, or live features whose old wiring did
not fully survive the daemon migration.

Recommended sequence (updated):

1. ~~Finish current thought-stream cleanup leftovers.~~ **Resolved in
   PR #950** — one stale line removed from `daemon-final-architecture.md`
   (the only current-state doc still claiming the daemon was responsible
   for "thought streaming"); other hits are already-correct tombstones
   or pre-marked historical.
2. Remove or rebuild `desktop-control`. **Still the top blocker.**
3. ~~Treat GWS as a live feature with a daemon-wiring gap; do not delete it.~~
   **Resolved in PR #947.** Daemon now materializes the GWS accounts manifest
   via `prepareGwsManifest` and registers `gws-mcp` / `gmail-mcp` /
   `calendar-mcp` per task.
4. ~~Decide product direction for connectors, cloud browser, knowledge notes,
   and language prompting.~~ **Wiring resolved in PR #947** — all five
   dropped features (GWS, connectors, knowledge notes, cloud browser,
   OpenAI `store: false`, UI language) now flow through `resolveTaskConfig`
   on the daemon path. Product audit still recommended to confirm UX.
5. ~~Remove old desktop OpenCode config generation after any needed behavior is
   migrated to the daemon.~~ **Resolved in PR #951** — deleted
   `apps/desktop/src/main/opencode/config-generator.ts` (−245 LOC) after
   verifying zero live importers for all 7 exported symbols. GWS manifest
   prep already lives in agent-core per PR #947.
6. ~~Clean small duplicate utilities and scratch files.~~ **Resolved in
   PR #948** — 6 P3 items deleted (-1483 LOC).

## Notes By Area

### Desktop Control

**Status: still open.** Top remaining deletion candidate.

This is the cleanest large deletion candidate. The current code advertises a
capability to the agent, but the implementation shape does not match how local
MCP servers are launched elsewhere in the repo.

Evidence:

- Registered as a local MCP server in
  `packages/agent-core/src/opencode/generator-mcp.ts`.
- Implementation lives at
  `packages/agent-core/mcp-tools/desktop-control/src/index.ts`.
- The implementation exports `serve()` but does not invoke it at module load,
  and it does not set up an MCP stdio transport.

Decision:

- Rebuild it as a real MCP stdio tool; or
- Remove the MCP registration, package, prompt/tool documentation, bundle entry,
  and related blocklist storage.

### GWS

**Status: resolved in PR #947.**

GWS is fully live on the daemon path as of PR #947. The per-task `gws-mcp` /
`gmail-mcp` / `calendar-mcp` servers are registered through `resolveTaskConfig`
step 7, which calls `prepareGwsManifest` to materialize the per-task manifest
file and lazy-refresh any near-expiry tokens inline.

Post-PR #947 state:

- `packages/agent-core/src/google-accounts/prepare-manifest.ts` reads
  `google_accounts` rows via direct SQL, refreshes tokens that are within
  `TOKEN_REFRESH_MARGIN_MS`, and writes both per-account token files and the
  manifest atomically.
- `resolveTaskConfig` consumes the returned manifest path + summary and sets
  `gwsAccountsManifestPath` + `gwsAccountsSummary` on the generated config.
- Desktop still owns the background refresh timer via `TokenManager`; daemon
  does best-effort lazy refresh as a belt-and-braces last line of defense for
  scheduled / WhatsApp tasks running without a live desktop.

Remaining desktop cleanup: ~~the old manifest producer at
`apps/desktop/src/main/opencode/config-generator.ts` is now fully orphan.~~
**Resolved in PR #951** — file deleted (−245 LOC).

### Other Task Config Features

**Status: wiring resolved in PR #947; workspace-meta split retired by the
v030 consolidation (this PR).**

User connectors, cloud browser config, workspace knowledge notes, language
prompting, and OpenAI `store: false` all now flow through `resolveTaskConfig`
on the daemon path per PR #947. The workspace-meta portion of that PR — the
daemon-side `initializeMetaDatabase` band-aid — has been superseded: the
`workspaces`, `workspace_meta`, and `knowledge_notes` tables now live in the
main `accomplish.db` (migration v030), and the retired `workspace-meta.db`
file is deleted from disk after a verified import. The daemon no longer
needs a second DB handle.

Evidence:

- Daemon `task-config-builder.ts` routes through `resolveTaskConfig` with
  `accomplishRuntime`, `accomplishStorageDeps`, `configFileName`, and the
  workspace-scoped `OnBeforeStartContext`.
- `apps/daemon/src/storage-service.ts` calls `initializeMetaDatabase` alongside
  the main DB so knowledge-note lookups via `getKnowledgeNotesForPrompt` do
  not silently fail.

### Completion Continuation

**Status: still open, explicitly deferred.**

Do not delete the whole completion system. The complete-task detection path is
still important. The likely-dead part is the older continuation-nudge branch
that depended on PTY-era lifecycle callbacks. Removal should be surgical because
the continuation state machine shares types/state with live completion handling.

Why it was deferred from PR #948: the dormant surface (`handleStepFinish`,
`handleProcessExit`, `onStartContinuation` callback, `getContinuationPrompt` /
`getPartialContinuationPrompt`, and most of the continuation-attempt
state-machine internals) is covered by ~600 LOC of tests that exercise behavior
no longer reachable from the runtime. Bundling that test refactor into a
deletion-only sweep would have blown up the diff. It needs its own PR where
the state-machine surgery and test changes can be reviewed as one unit.

Live parts to preserve: `handleCompleteTaskDetection`, `markTaskRequiresCompletion`,
`markToolsUsed`, `updateTodos`, `getState`, and the `complete_task` tool wiring
in `OpenCodeAdapter.handlePartUpdated`.

### Thought Stream

**Status: runtime deleted in PR #945; docs cleanup closed in PR #950.**

Runtime removal landed in PR #945. Post-cleanup scan (PR #950) found the only
remaining stale line in a current-state doc was `daemon-final-architecture.md`
line 16, which still listed "thought streaming" as a daemon responsibility in
the Owner table — removed. Other references are already-correct tombstones
that explicitly document the removal (e.g. `functional-viewpoint.md:422`,
`apps/daemon/src/index.ts:215-218`), or live inside `daemon-code-audit.md`
which is pre-marked HISTORICAL at the top of the file.
